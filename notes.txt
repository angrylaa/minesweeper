recusrive sql
1. want a table w/ 1 row for each number from 1->10
2. when using recursive sql, we want 2 columns
    - 1st column is the current value of the variable
    - 2nd column is the next value

-> first query
with T(N, N2) as 
( 
    select 1, 2 from sysibm.sysdummy1
) // first thing u do in recursive table, we define the first row (trivial case)

select N from T; --> result is 1

-> recursive query

with T(N, N2) as 
( 
    select 1, 2 from sysibm.sysdummy1 --> initial term
    UNION ALL
    select N2, N2 + 1 from T --> next term
    WHERE N <= 10 --> catcher value to prevent infinte loop
) 

select N from T; --> result is 1 to 10
